					<p>The iPhone is a smartphone made by Apple that combines a computer, iPod, digital camera and cellular phone into one device with a touchscreen interface. The iPhone runs the iOS operating system, and in 2021 when the iPhone 13 was introduced, it offered up to 1 TB of storage and a 12-megapixel camera.

The original iPhone was announced on Jan. 9, 2007, at the Macworld convention by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. While it was not considered the first smartphone, the iPhone has helped drive the global shift to mobile computing among both consumers and businesses. Its primary rival has been Google Android-based devices from companies such as Samsung, also introduced in 2007.

The first-generation iPhone came preloaded with a suite of Apple software, including iTunes, the Safari web browser and iPhoto. Internet Message Access Protocol and Post Office Protocol 3 email services were integrated with the device.

Apple released the iPhone under an exclusive two-year partnership with AT&T Wireless, but it took less than three months for hackers to unlock the device for use on any Global System for Mobile communication network.</p>
